Digital Dot is multiplayer web-based game which allow two players push the spark ball by "FORCE". Digital Dot is developed with Cocos2D-X game engine.

## Purpose

This project was created for training developing software with the individual software process. But the most expected result is the fun and happiness of players.

## Iteration

I separated this project into two iteration.

### 1st Iteration

In this iteration I expected to complete all of basic structure of the game.

So I started from drafting the project in Paint. LOL

Then I start coding all of basic structure of game like moving ,collision checking, multiplayer keyboard controlling. Finally, in the first iteration the project is look like this.

### 2nd Iteration

In iteration one I finished a lot of thing, so I though that I can finish a lot of thing in this iteration too. However the world wasn't beautiful, there was too many other work. So I can finish only basic function of game to make this game is complete game.

## Inspiration

Have you ever played air hockey in game center? I use that concept and add the madness to it. :S

## Difficulty

1. Manual 8 Direction Collision Detect (In fact it must apply other type of collision detect.)

2. Incomplete controlling system (But it makes this game more fun.)

3. Clean code (But the end is shitty code.)

## Project Status

This is quite old project which I was developed when I was 1st student at Kasetsart University. So I decide to stop this project for doing other project. Maybe it might remake in the future.
